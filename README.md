#Learning Tensorflow JS

#Handwritten No detection using CNN

In this tutorial, we'll build a TensorFlow.js model to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network. First, we'll train the classifier by having it �look� at thousands of handwritten digit images and their labels. Then we'll evaluate the classifier's accuracy using test data that the model has never seen.

#CNN

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
